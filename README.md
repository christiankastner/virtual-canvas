# Virtual-Canvas-Frontend

Flatiron School Module 5 Project Frontend by [Christian Kastner](https://github.com/ckastner12)

Virtual canvas is an app meant for visual and audio artists. Users can jump in and share canvases display animations across shared canvases through clicks and groups of people to collaboratively build and audio visualizer. Through the technology of web sockets and rails ActionCable, the front end can recieve data from different computers on the same canvas to render changes you have made, in real time, onto another's screen. 

## Installation

```bash
